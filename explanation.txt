I used the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to identify outliers because it's a robust technique that isn't influenced by anomalous distributions. This method is suitable for outlier detection in revenue data (grossUSD).

This algorithm would scale well in a production pipeline because it's simple and efficient.
However, if the amount of data significantly increases, other techniques such as model-based outlier detection could be considered, although the complexity and computational cost may increase.
